Run chef-client.

Run 'shutdown -h -t 1'


### Ubuntu 12.10

### The following steps caan be repeated to create many nodes as you want

In the Virtualbox Manager window, select your not running my-easybake-vm and choose Machine->clone from the menu.

Select Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards.
Select Linked clone.

Start your newly cloned vm, windows will restart once as we change the hostname.

On login to new clone, run (w/ sudo on linux) chef-client within a terminal, cmd or powershell.



### Gotchas

We don't have a chef-repo yet, but git clone should work.

We regenerate user and org keys by default, and copying the validator between windows/linux vms isn't automatic.

Windows requires a reboot on first boot of new clone for hostname change.


Goto manage.opscode.com and see all your windows  and linux nodes.
